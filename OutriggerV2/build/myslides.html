<ul>
<li><p><strong>Industrialization</strong>: the development of industries in a country or region on a wide scale.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Mechanization</strong>: Mechanization is the process of changing from working largely or exclusively by hand or with animals to doing that work with machinery.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Economic conditions</strong>: refers to the present state of the economy in a country or region.</p></li>

<h2>Another definition</h2>

<h2>The Telegraph</h2>
<p>A “telegraph” is a device for transmitting and receiving messages over long distances, i.e., for telegraphy. … A telegraph message sent by an electrical telegraph operator or telegrapher using Morse code (or a printing telegraph operator using plain text) was known as a telegram.</p>

<p>Outrigger is a better out of office responder with smarter email notifications.</p>
</section><section id="origin-story" class="slide level2">
<h2>Origin Story</h2>
<p>The idea for Outrigger began on a family vacation and was shaped by the observation that most email out of office (OOO) messages either create too much friction when a message is truly urgent or rub the original sender the wrong way. As a result, people rarely set them and when they do, many check their email anyway.</p>
</section><section id="section-2" class="slide level2">
<h2></h2>
<p>This OOO message helped inspire Outrigger. <br> It suggests five different people that the sender could contact for assistance.</p>
<p><img src="./images/ooo.png" style="height:70%; width:70%;"></p>
</section><section id="section-3" class="slide level2">
<h2></h2>
<p>By contrast, this is an Outrigger OOO message.</p>
<p><img src="./images/outriggerooo.png" style="height:65%; width:65%;"></p>
</section><section id="section-4" class="slide level2">
<h2></h2>
<p>If the sender clicks the button, <br> the Outrigger user gets this (via text). <br> In the future, the notification could go to a teammate.</p>
<p><img src="./images/notification.png" style="height:60%; width:60%;"></p>
<p>Additionally, modern emails services (Google/Microsoft) <br> do a good job identifying important emails but struggle to identify urgent emails.</p>
</section><section id="why-is-this-a-problem" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why is this a problem?</h2>
<p>There are <strong>3.7 billion</strong> email accounts worldwide. <br> Each day, a staggering <strong>269 billion</strong> emails are sent.</p>
<p>That is <strong>73 emails</strong> per account per day.</p>
<p><strong><em>How many of these are truly urgent?</em></strong></p>
<p>It takes an average of <strong>23 minutes</strong> to regain focus after an interruption.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>growing expectation of availability</strong> via mobile devices and it is <strong>exceedingly difficult to unplug</strong>.</p>
</section><section id="section-5" class="slide level2">
<h2></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>I built Outrigger to solve these problems and help people create some space between themselves and their email inboxes to better focus on <br> what’s important.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="what-is-it" class="slide level2">
<h2>What is it?</h2>
</section><section id="features" class="slide level2">
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Customizable Notifications</strong>: Get email notifications through your preferred channel (SMS (text), FB Messenger, Telegram, Slack, etc)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Auto-Replies</strong>: When you need to focus, Outrigger responds to emails with a customizable message and notification link (useful for during school, expos, meetings, etc).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>VIP Whitelist</strong>: Immediately receive a notification when a VIP emails you (teachers, etc).</p></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="features-contd." class="slide level2">
<h2>Features Cont’d.</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Periscope Mode</strong>: If someone replies to an email you sent within a set time, you get a notification. Keep important conversations going.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Contacts Integration</strong>: Only send auto-replies to people in your contacts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Customizable Filters</strong>: Limit which emails receive an auto-reply.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Blacklist</strong>: Want to ghost someone? Add them to your blacklist!</p></li>
</ul>
</section><section id="roadmap" class="slide level2">
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Calendar Integration</strong>: Outrigger will turn itself on or off based on your calendar appointments or a set schedule.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Machine Learning/AI</strong>: Eventually Outrigger will determine the best settings for your inbox. Additionally, it will learn who is important in your network and prioritize urgent notifications from them.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p><img src="./images/outrigger.png" style="height:70%; width:70%;"></p>
<p>With a database storing user accounts, Outrigger is able to leverage enough of Google’s APIs to allow for a maximum of 6-16% CPU usage during peak use hours (this is low).</p>
</section><section id="infrastructure" class="slide level2">
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Currently, Outrigger is running on a single free tier instance on AWS. It will be free until the end of 2018. Afterward <strong>Outrigger will cost less than $10 per month to run</strong> (at its current scale, which supports hundreds of users).</p>
</section><section id="maintainability" class="slide level2">
<h2>Maintainability</h2>
<p>At <strong>11,523</strong> Lines of JavaScript spread across <strong>83</strong> files, Outrigger is reasonably maintainable. Outrigger only requires <strong>52</strong> dependencies from NPM, most of which are used for logging (this is low).</p>
