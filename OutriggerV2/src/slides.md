## The Telegraph

A key invention during the Industrial Revolution was the Telegraph.

<!--A "telegraph" is a device for transmitting and receiving messages over
long distances, i.e., for telegraphy. ... A telegraph message sent by an
electrical telegraph operator or telegrapher using Morse code (or a
printing telegraph operator using plain text) was known as a telegram.-->

## Telegraph Cont'd

- Developed during the Industrial Revolution, proliferated shortly after
- Used to transfer messages across long distances
- Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail developed the most prevalent system
- Made the Pony Express obsolete in the US
- Used until the invention of computers
- Morse Code still used today


## Today’s Telegraph is email
- Invented in 1972
- Proliferated in the early 1990s
- Ubiquitous and largely overwhelming today
- While texting has recently proliferated, email still dominates

## The Problem with email

There are **3.7 billion** email accounts worldwide. <br> Each day, a staggering
**269 billion** emails are sent.

That is **73 emails** per account per day.

By the time we graduate, email volume will be <br> **320 billion** per day.

___How many of these are truly urgent?___

It takes an average of **23 minutes** to regain focus after an
interruption.

There is a **growing expectation of availability** via mobile devices and it
is **exceedingly difficult to unplug**.

## 

> I built Outrigger to solve these problems and help people create some space between themselves and their email inboxes to better focus on <br> what’s important.

##

Outrigger is a better out of office responder with smarter email
notifications.

## Origin Story

The idea for Outrigger began on a family vacation and was shaped by the
observation that most email out of office (OOO) messages either create
too much friction when a message is truly urgent or rub the original
sender the wrong way. As a result, people rarely set them and when they
do, many check their email anyway.

##

This OOO message helped inspire Outrigger. <br> It suggests five different
people that the sender could contact for assistance.

## 

By contrast, this is an Outrigger OOO message.

##
If the sender clicks the button, <br> the Outrigger user gets this. (via
text) <br> In the future, the notification could go to a teammate.

Additionally, modern emails services (Google/Microsoft) <br> do a good job
identifying important emails but struggle to identify urgent emails.



## What is Outrigger?

## Features

    preferred channel. (SMS (text), FB Messenger, Telegram, Slack,
    etc.)

    emails with a customizable message and notification link. (useful for
    during school, expos, meetings, etc.)

-   **VIP Whitelist**: Immediately receive a notification when a VIP
    emails you. (teachers, etc.)

## Features Cont'd

    set time, you get a notification. Keep important conversations
    going.

    contacts.

    best settings for your inbox. Additionally, it will learn who is
    important in your network and prioritize urgent notifications from
    them.

## Technical

## Architecture

<img src="./images/outrigger.png" style="height:70%; width:70%;">

With a database storing user accounts, Outrigger is able to leverage
enough of Google's APIs to allow for a maximum of 6-16% CPU usage during
peak use hours. (this is low)

## Infrastructure

Currently, Outrigger is running on a single free tier instance on AWS.
It will be free until the end of 2018. Afterward **Outrigger will cost
less than \$10 per month to run**. (at its current scale, which supports
hundreds of users)

## Maintainability

At **11,523** lines of JavaScript spread across **83** files, Outrigger
is reasonably maintainable. Outrigger only requires **52** dependencies
from NPM, most of which are used for logging. (this is low)

## Private Beta
 Outrigger is available today for Gmail and G-Suite users. Let me know if you want to try it.
