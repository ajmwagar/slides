<p>Outrigger is a better out of office responder. With smarter email notifications for Gmail and G-Suite users.</p>
</section><section id="origin-story" class="slide level2">
<h2>Origin Story</h2>
<p>The idea for Outrigger began on a family vacation and was shaped by the observation that most email out of office (OOO) messages either create too much friction when a message is truly urgent or rub the original sender the wrong way. As a result, people rarely set them and when they do, many check their email anyway.</p>
</section><section id="why" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why?</h2>
</section><section id="section-2" class="slide level2">
<h2></h2>
<p>There are 3.7 billion email accounts world wide. Each day, humans sent a staggering <strong>269 billion</strong> emails.</p>
</section><section id="section-3" class="slide level2">
<h2></h2>
<p>Every day, the average office worker receives 121 emails and sends out 40 emails.</p>
</section><section id="section-4" class="slide level2">
<h2></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed and built Outrigger to help people, including ourselves, create some space between themselves and their email inboxes to better focus on whatever’s important.</p>
