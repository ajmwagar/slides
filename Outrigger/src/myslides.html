<h2>Origin Story</h2>
<p>The idea for Outrigger began on a family vacation and was shaped by the observation that most email out of office (OOO) messages either create too much friction when a message is truly urgent or rub the original sender the wrong way. As a result, people rarely set them and when they do, many check their email anyway.</p>
</section><section id="what-is-it" class="slide level2">
<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>In an oversimplification: Outrigger is a better out of office responder. With better email notifications</p>
</section><section id="why" class="slide level2">
<h2>Why?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed and built Outrigger to help people, including ourselves, create some space between themselves and their email inboxes to better focus on whatever’s important.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="features" class="slide level2">
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Customizable Notifications</strong>: Get email notifications through your preferred channel (SMS, Slack, Telegram, etc…)</li>
<li><strong>Auto-Replies</strong>: Respond to new messages with a customizable message and notification link. (Useful for expos and meetings, etc…)</li>
<li><strong>VIP Whitelist</strong>: Immediately receive a notification when a VIP emails you.</li>
<li><strong>Periscope</strong>: If someone replies to an email you sent before a user-defined interval, you get a notification.</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="features-cont." class="slide level2">
<h2>Features Cont.</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contact Integration</strong>: Only send auto-replies to people in your contacts.</li>
<li><strong>Customizable filters</strong>: Setup filters limit auto-replies being sent.</li>
<li><strong>Blacklist</strong>: Hate your snobby neighbor? Want to stop sending them Auto-Replies? Then, add them to your blacklist!</li>
</ul>
</section><section id="roadmap" class="slide level2">
<h2>Roadmap</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Calendar integration</strong>: Outrigger will turn itself on or off based on your calendar appointments.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning/AI</strong>: Eventually Outrigger will determine the best settings for your inbox. Additionally, it will learn who is important in your network and prioritize notifications from them.</li>
