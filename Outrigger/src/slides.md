##

Outrigger is a better out of office responder with smarter email
notifications.

## Origin Story

The idea for Outrigger began on a family vacation and was shaped by the
observation that most email out of office (OOO) messages either create
too much friction when a message is truly urgent or rub the original
sender the wrong way. As a result, people rarely set them and when they
do, many check their email anyway.

##

This OOO message helped inspire Outrigger. It suggests five different
people that the sender could contact for assistance.

## 

By contrast, this is an Outrigger OOO message.

##
If the sender clicks the button, <br> the Outrigger user gets this (via
text). <br> In the future, the notification could go to a teammate.


<img src="./images/notification.png" style="height:60%; width:60%;">

Additionally, modern emails services (Google/Microsoft) <br> do a good job
identifying important emails but struggle to identify urgent emails.

## Why is this a problem?

There are **3.7 billion** email accounts worldwide. <br> Each day, a staggering
**269 billion** emails are sent.

That is **73 emails** per account per day.

___How many of these are truly urgent?___

It takes an average of **23 minutes** to regain focus after an
interruption.

There is a **growing expectation of availability** via mobile devices and it
is **exceedingly difficult to unplug**.

## 

> I built Outrigger to solve these problems and help people create some space between themselves and their email inboxes to better focus on whatâ€™s important.

## What is it?

## Features

-   **Customizable Notifications**: Get email notifications through your
    preferred channel (SMS (text), FB Messenger, Telegram, Slack,
    etc...)

-   **Auto-Replies**: When you need to focus, Outrigger responds to
    emails with a customizable message and notification link (useful for
    during school, expos, meetings, etc...).

-   **VIP Whitelist**: Immediately receive a notification when a VIP
    emails you (teachers, etc).

## Features Cont'd.

-   **Periscope Mode**: If someone replies to an email you sent within a
    set time, you get a notification. Keep important conversations
    going.

-   **Contacts Integration**: Only send auto-replies to people in your
    contacts.

-   **Customizable Filters**: limit which emails receive an auto-reply.

-   **Blacklist**: Want to ghost someone? Add them to your blacklist!

## Roadmap

-   **Calendar Integration**: Outrigger will turn itself on or off based
    on your calendar appointments or a set schedule.

-   **Machine Learning/AI**: Eventually Outrigger will determine the
    best settings for your inbox. Additionally, it will learn who is
    important in your network and prioritize urgent notifications from
    them.

## Technical

## Architecture

<img src="./images/outrigger.png">
With a database storing user accounts, Outrigger is able to leverage
enough of Google's APIs to allow for a maximum of 6-16% CPU usage during
peak use hours (this is low).

## Infrastructure

Currently, Outrigger is running on a single free tier instance on AWS.
It will be free until the end of 2018. Afterward **Outrigger will cost
less than \$10 per month to run** (at its current scale, which supports
hundreds of users).

## Maintainability

At **11,523** Lines of JavaScript spread across **83** files, Outrigger
is reasonably maintainable. Outrigger only requires **52** dependencies
from NPM, most of which are used for logging (this is low).
